# IITC plugin : Suspend Activate Filters


Save a group of filters in a preset and activate (or suspend) it when you need with one click.

when reswue plugin exists with an active operation, suspend activate filters parse the layers name to remove the operation name. this has effect of preserving the same layer name whatever the active operation... i hope :-)
