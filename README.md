# suspend_activate_filters

Save a group of filters in a preset and activate (or suspend) it when you need in one click.

when reswue plugin exists with an active operation, suspend_activate_filters parse the layers name to remove the operation name. this has effect of preserving the same layer name whatever the active operation... i hope :-)
